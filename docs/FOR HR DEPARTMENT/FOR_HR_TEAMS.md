# Value Rollercoaster: For HR Teams

## 🎯 Why This Matters to You

**Every interaction shapes how coworkers live company values**—whether you're facilitating internal integration, helping employees understand values, or building organizational alignment. Value Rollercoaster helps you enable coworkers to **live company values** in their daily work, making values tangible, actionable tools they use—not just abstract concepts on a wall.

## 💡 The Core Idea

### Your Values, Your Way

Your organization has unique value propositions—but **every team member interprets them differently**. A strategic value like "Partnership Development" means something different to your HR team than it does to your sales team. This app helps you:

- **Define your values** across 4 categories: Technical, Business, Strategic, and After Sales
- **See how coworkers interpret them**—discover different perspectives within your organization
- **Help employees live values**—understand how values apply to daily work and how everyone contributes to sales

### Everyone is Selling

You might not think of yourself as a salesperson, but **every customer interaction is a sales moment**—even if employees aren't aware of it:

- Customer support resolving issues → selling trust and reliability
- Technical teams explaining features → selling expertise and innovation
- Account managers building relationships → selling partnership and value
- **Everyone** → contributing to sales through values

This app helps you **show coworkers how they're selling** by demonstrating how their work and values create customer value.

## 🤖 AI as Your Creative Support

Value Rollercoaster uses **three AI models working together** to transform individual employee inputs into customer-focused benefits:

1. **Google Gemini**: Structured analysis and transformation of value components into customer benefits
2. **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Creative insights and alternative perspectives in benefit generation
3. **Sonar (Perplexity)**: Quality validation to prevent hallucinations and ensure accuracy

**Quality gates at every step** ensure the AI delivers accurate, reliable transformations—demonstrating **real, practical AI usage** that supports work creatively and safely. This shows coworkers how AI can genuinely support their work, not replace it.

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Core Transformation: From Individual Input to Customer Value

**This is the heart of Value Rollercoaster.** Every employee interprets company values differently—and that's a strength. The platform transforms these diverse perspectives into a unified understanding of customer value.

**The Core Process:**

1. **Individual Input**: Each employee fills in value components based on their role and perspective
   - HR sees "Partnership Development" as employee engagement and retention
   - Sales sees it as customer relationships
   - Technical teams see it as collaborative development
   - Customer support sees it as ongoing service relationships

2. **AI Transformation**: Using your company's background (from admin settings) and **three AI models working together** (Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT, and Perplexity Sonar), the platform transforms each input into **customer-focused benefits**

3. **Customer Value Visibility**: Every employee sees how their work creates value for customers—connecting their daily tasks to customer success

**Why This Matters for HR:**

- **Everyone Sees Their Contribution**: Even employees not directly in sales see how their work drives customer value and company success
- **Unified Customer Focus**: Different perspectives become a cohesive understanding of what customers need
- **Values Become Real**: Values move from abstract concepts to tangible tools employees use daily

### Practical Application: Persona Generation

Once your value components are defined (90% completion required), the platform uses them to analyze prospect websites and generate buyer personas. This demonstrates the practical power of your transformed values—showing exactly how your offerings match customer needs.

**How to Use:**
1. **Define Values**: Each employee fills in value components from their perspective
2. **See Customer Benefits**: AI transforms inputs into customer-focused value
3. **Generate Personas**: Use transformed values to analyze prospects and see alignment
4. **Build Alignment**: Use insights to improve internal understanding and customer conversations

## 🌟 What This Means for You

- **Help coworkers live values** by showing how their individual inputs transform into customer value
- **Facilitate values understanding** by making the transformation process visible to all employees
- **Show different interpretations** and how AI unifies them into customer-focused benefits
- **Build organizational alignment** through shared understanding of how everyone contributes to customer value
- **Demonstrate value contribution** by making it visible how each employee's work creates customer value


## ⚠️ Important: This is NOT a Recruitment Tool

**This app is NOT about:**
- Finding candidates

- Job postings or candidate outreach
- Recruitment strategies

**This app IS about:**
- Helping coworkers live company values
