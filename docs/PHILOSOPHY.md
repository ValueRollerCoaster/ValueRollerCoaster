# The Story Behind Value Rollercoaster

## Why This Exists

This app started from a simple observation: **company values are important, but they could be even more powerful if they were tools people actually use in their daily work.**

I've seen values everywhere—posters in conference rooms, mission statements on websites, culture decks that inspire teams. These are valuable foundations. But what if we could take them further? **What if values could be tools you actually use?** Tools that help you understand customers better, have better conversations, and see how your work creates value?

That's what I'm trying to do here.

## The Technical Motivation

I wanted to explore **real, practical AI usage** beyond demos and hype. I was curious: can multiple AI models work together with quality gates (similar to real production companies) to create something genuinely useful? Can we use AI as creative support rather than replacement?

So I built this tool as an experiment—combining Gemini, ChatGPT, and Perplexity's Sonar with validation at every step. The result? A working system that demonstrates how AI can support work safely and transparently, with quality checks preventing hallucinations and providing confidence scores.

### The AI Models I Use

The app uses **three AI models** working together:

1. **Google Gemini** - For deep website analysis and comprehensive persona insights
2. **OpenAI ChatGPT** - For structured persona generation and value alignment
3. **Perplexity Sonar** - For fact-checking, quality gates, and relevance validation

**Why these models?** For development, I chose Gemini and ChatGPT because they're among the largest, most capable models available, and they offer free tiers for small usage—perfect for building and testing. Sonar was the only paid service, costing around $10 for the development phase, providing essential quality validation.

**Important note:** If your company uses better or more advanced models, the results will be better too. The architecture supports swapping in different models—whether that's newer versions of these same models, enterprise-grade alternatives, or specialized models for specific tasks. Better models mean more accurate analysis, richer insights, and higher-quality personas.

## The Core Problem

### Values Can Be More Actionable

Most organizations have values. They're on the wall, in the handbook, on the website. They provide important guidance and direction. But when you're in a sales call, or talking to a customer, or making a decision—could those values be even more helpful?

Often, they're presented in abstract terms that don't directly connect to your daily work. There's an opportunity to make them more tangible, more specific, and more directly applicable to the conversations and decisions you face every day.

### Everyone Interprets Values Differently (And That's Good)

When you ask different departments what "Innovation" means, you get different answers:
- Sales: "New solutions for customers"
- R&D: "Cutting-edge research"
- IT: "Technical excellence"
- Marketing: "Fresh positioning"

**This isn't a problem—it's a strength.** Different perspectives make values richer and more applicable. Most tools focus on a single interpretation, but there's an opportunity to capture and leverage all these different perspectives.

Value Rollercoaster uses a structured framework (4 categories: Technical, Business, Strategic, After Sales) to capture these diverse perspectives and transform them into unified customer value. [Learn more about the value components structure](Usage/Settings/VALUE_COMPONENTS_OVERVIEW.md).

### Everyone Is Selling (Even If They Don't Know It)

Every customer interaction is a sales moment, even if people don't realize it:
- Customer support resolving an issue → selling trust
- Technical team explaining features → selling expertise
- Account managers building relationships → selling partnership for now and future

When people recognize this connection, they can leverage it more effectively and see how their work directly contributes to customer value—even if they're not in sales.

## What I'm Trying to Do

Building on the foundation of existing values, I want to make them **tools you use in your work**:
- Tools for understanding customers
- Tools for having better conversations
- Tools for seeing how your work creates value
- Tools for connecting what you do to what customers need

I also want to help you see how different departments interpret the same value, and use those different perspectives to create richer customer conversations.

The platform organizes these diverse interpretations into a structured framework that covers the complete customer journey—from technical evaluation to ongoing support. [See how the value components structure works](Usage/Settings/VALUE_COMPONENTS_OVERVIEW.md).

## What This App Is (And Isn't)

### What It Is

- **A tool that helps you use values in your work**—not just read them
- **A way to see how values are interpreted differently**—and use that diversity
- **A practical example of AI supporting work**—not replacing it
- **A starting point for better conversations**—not the entire conversation
- **A helpful research tool**—that saves time and provides insights

### What It Isn't

- **Not a replacement for your expertise**—you still need your skills, experience, and judgment
- **Not a magic solution**—it's one tool in your toolkit, not the entire toolkit
- **Not a replacement for relationship building**—you still need to build trust
- **Not a solution for everything**—it helps with some things, not all things

## My Approach

### Open Source and Transparent

I made this open source because:
- **Transparency**: You can see how it works, verify security, understand the process
- **Control**: IT has full control over deployment and security
- **Cost-Effective**: No licensing fees, only API costs
- **Customizable**: You can adapt it to your needs
- **Practical**: Real, working AI—not theoretical promises

### Realistic Expectations

I'm honest about what this does and doesn't do: it helps with preparation, enhances conversations, and supports work—but success still requires your expertise and judgment.

**Two Real Scenarios:**

**Internal Sales Team (No Field Experience)**: A customer service representative preparing for their first client call. They generate a persona, review the alignment matrix, and gain better understanding (trends, where the prospect is now, what could be done, SPIN methodology aspects) based on evidence from the prospect's website. The tool gives them a bit more confidence and structure—but they still need to listen actively, build rapport, and close the call or meeting. The tool doesn't replace sales skills; it helps them start from a better position.

**External Sales Team (Experienced Managers)**: A seasoned account manager traveling between clients with many years of real experience. They use the tool to gain a fresh perspective, identify new alignment opportunities in existing accounts, and prepare for competitive situations. It saves hours of manual research—but their years of relationship-building, industry knowledge, and negotiation skills are what actually close deals. The tool enhances their process; it doesn't replace their expertise.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about buyer personas or sales tools. It's about:

**Helping coworkers live company values** by making values tangible and actionable—not abstract concepts, but tools people use in their work.

**Showing practical AI usage** that supports work creatively and safely—demonstrating how AI can be used in business without replacing human expertise.

**Connecting everyone to customer value** by showing how different work contributes to sales and customer outcomes—even if people don't realize they're selling.

**Creating better alignment** by helping people see how values are interpreted differently, and how those different interpretations create richer value.

## Why "Value Rollercoaster"?

Values aren't static. They're dynamic. They change based on context, interpretation, and application. Like a rollercoaster, they have ups and downs, twists and turns. But when you understand them, you can navigate them—and use them to create value.


I'm not trying to solve everything. I'm trying to help with one thing: **making values actionable tools you use, not abstract concepts you read.**

If this resonates with you, I'd love your help making it better.
