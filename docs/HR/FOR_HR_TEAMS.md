# Value Rollercoaster: For HR Teams

## 🎯 Why This Matters to You

**Every interaction shapes how coworkers live company values**—whether you're facilitating internal integration, helping employees understand values, or building organizational alignment. Value Rollercoaster helps you enable coworkers to **live company values** in their daily work, making values tangible, actionable tools they use—not just abstract concepts on a wall.

## 💡 The Core Idea

### Your Values, Your Way

Your organization has unique value propositions—but **every team member interprets them differently**. A strategic value like "Partnership Development" means something different to your HR team than it does to your sales team. This app helps you:

- **Define your values** across 4 categories: Technical, Business, Strategic, and After Sales
- **See how coworkers interpret them**—discover different perspectives within your organization
- **Help employees live values**—understand how values apply to daily work and how everyone contributes to sales

### Everyone is Selling

You might not think of yourself as a salesperson, but **every customer interaction is a sales moment**—even if employees aren't aware of it:

- Customer support resolving issues → selling trust and reliability
- Technical teams explaining features → selling expertise and innovation
- Account managers building relationships → selling partnership and value
- **Everyone** → contributing to sales through values

This app helps you **show coworkers how they're selling** by demonstrating how their work and values create customer value.

## 🤖 AI as Your Creative Support

Value Rollercoaster uses **three AI models working together** to analyze companies and match them with your values:

1. **Google Gemini**: Structured analysis and data validation
2. **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Creative insights and alternative perspectives
3. **Sonar (Perplexity)**: Quality validation to prevent hallucinations

**Quality gates at every step** ensure the AI delivers accurate, reliable results—demonstrating **real, practical AI usage** that supports work creatively and safely.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Define Your Values
Your organization defines value components that represent what you offer. These aren't just words on a wall—they're the real value your organization delivers every day.

### Step 2: Generate Personas
Enter a company website URL. The AI analyzes their needs, pain points, and goals, then **matches them with your value components**.

### Step 3: See the Alignment
Get a clear alignment matrix showing:
- Which of your values match their needs
- Match scores (0-100%) for each alignment
- Evidence from their website supporting each match
- Conversation starters ready to use

**This app IS about:**

## 💬 The Bigger Picture
