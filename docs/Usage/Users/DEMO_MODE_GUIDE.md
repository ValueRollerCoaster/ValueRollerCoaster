## What is Demo Mode?

**Demo Mode** is a feature that lets you try Value Rollercoaster with pre-populated demo data. Instead of configuring your own company values from scratch, you can select one of five funny demo companies that come with:

- **Pre-filled value components** (all 4 categories with realistic data)
- **Demo customers** (3 customers per company for persona generation)
- **Complete company profiles** (business intelligence, products, target customers, etc.)

Demo Mode is perfect for:
- **First-time users** who want to see how the app works
- **Training and demonstrations** without using real company data
- **Testing features** without setting up your own company profile
- **Learning the workflow** before configuring your actual company

---

## Why Does Demo Mode Exist?

Demo Mode was created to solve several problems:

### 1. **Lower Barrier to Entry**
Setting up value components for the first time can be overwhelming. Demo Mode lets you see the app in action immediately, so you understand what you're building toward.

### 2. **Safe Testing Environment**
You can experiment with persona generation, value alignment, and all features without affecting your real company data. Demo data is completely isolated from your actual data.

### 3. **Training and Onboarding**
Perfect for training new users or demonstrating the app to stakeholders. You can show the full workflow without needing real customer websites or company information.

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
Even in Demo Mode, the app enforces the same quality standards:
- **90% value component completion is still required** (demo data is pre-filled, but the requirement remains)
- All AI models and quality gates work the same way
- You get the same quality personas and alignment matrices

### 5. **Fun and Engaging**
The demo companies are intentionally funny and memorable (coffee companies, weather services, time travel logistics). This makes learning the app more enjoyable and helps you remember how features work.

## How Demo Mode Works

### Technical Overview

Demo Mode uses a sophisticated data isolation system to keep demo data separate from your real company data:

#### 1. **User ID Isolation**

When you enable Demo Mode and select a demo company, the system creates a special demo user ID:

```
demo_user_{your_real_user_id}_{demo_company_id}
```

**Example:**
- Your real user ID: `user_123`
- Selected demo company: `coffeecorp`
- Demo user ID: `demo_user_user_123_coffeecorp`

This ensures:
- Each user has their own isolated demo data
- Different demo companies have separate data
- Your real data is never mixed with demo data

#### 2. **Value Components Population**

When you click "🎯 Load Demo", the system:

1. **Generates value components** based on the demo company profile
2. **Saves them to the database** using the demo user ID
3. **Updates session state** with demo data
4. **Makes demo customers available** for persona generation

The value components are generated using the same structure as real companies:
- **4 main categories:** Technical Value, Business Value, Strategic Value, After Sales Value
- **All subcategories and components** are populated
- **AI-processed values** are automatically generated
- **90% completion requirement** is met automatically

#### 3. **Demo Customer URLs**

Demo customers use a special URL format:

```
demo://{customer_id}
```

**Example:**
- Customer ID: `corporate_coffee_chain`
- Demo URL: `demo://corporate_coffee_chain`

When you generate a persona using a demo customer:
1. The system detects the `demo://` prefix
2. It looks up the demo customer data
3. It generates a persona using the demo customer's profile
4. The persona is marked with `demo_mode: True` in the database

#### 4. **Mode Switching**

When you switch between Demo Mode and Real Mode:

**Switching TO Demo Mode:**
- System checks if demo data already exists for your user
- If yes, it restores the existing demo data
- If no, you need to select and load a demo company

**Switching FROM Demo Mode:**
- System switches back to your real user ID
- Your real value components are restored
- Demo data remains saved but isolated
- You can switch back anytime

#### 5. **Data Persistence**

Demo data is saved in the database just like real data:
- **Value components** are stored with demo user ID
- **Generated personas** are stored with demo user ID
- **All data persists** between sessions
- **Data is isolated** per user and per demo company

---

## Important Notes and Limitations

### 1. **Value Components Still Required**

Even in Demo Mode, the app enforces the **90% value component completion requirement**. This ensures:
- Quality personas are generated
- The alignment matrix works correctly
- You understand the importance of complete value components

**What this means:**
- Demo data is pre-filled, so you meet the requirement automatically
- You can still edit demo value components if you want
- The requirement is the same whether using demo or real data

### 2. **Demo Data Isolation**

Demo data is completely isolated from your real data:
- **Separate user IDs** prevent data mixing
- **Separate database entries** for demo and real data
- **No cross-contamination** between modes

**What this means:**
- You can safely experiment in Demo Mode
- Your real data is never affected
- You can switch between modes freely

### 3. **Demo Personas**

Personas generated from demo customers:
- Are marked with `demo_mode: True`
- Are stored with demo user ID
- Can be viewed in Persona Search (filtered by mode)
- Use the same AI models and quality gates as real personas

### 4. **No Real Website Scraping**

Demo customers don't use real websites:
- Demo URLs (e.g., `demo://corporate_coffee_chain`) are not real websites
- Persona generation uses the demo customer's profile data
- No actual website scraping or analysis occurs
- This makes demo personas instant (no 5-8 minute wait)

### 5. **Demo Mode Availability**

Demo Mode can be:
- **Enabled globally** by administrators (affects all users)
- **Enabled per user** via the sidebar checkbox (if global mode is enabled)
- **Disabled globally** (checkbox won't appear)

### 6. **Switching Between Demo Companies**

You can switch between different demo companies:
1. Select a different demo company
2. Click "🎯 Load Demo" again
3. The new company's data will replace the previous demo data
4. Previous demo data is saved but not active

---

## Troubleshooting

### Demo Mode Checkbox Not Showing

**Problem:** You don't see the "🎭 DEMO Mode" checkbox in the sidebar.

**Solutions:**
1. Demo Mode may be disabled globally
2. Contact your administrator to enable Demo Mode
3. Check if `ENABLE_DEMO_MODE` is set to `True` in the configuration

### Demo Data Not Loading

**Problem:** Clicking "🎯 Load Demo" doesn't populate value components.

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you've selected a demo company first
2. Check your internet connection
3. Refresh the page and try again
4. Check the browser console for errors

### Demo Customers Not Appearing

**Problem:** You don't see demo customers in the Persona Generator tab.

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure Demo Mode is enabled (checkbox checked)
2. Make sure you've loaded demo data (clicked "🎯 Load Demo")
3. Check that you selected a demo company
4. Try switching to Real Mode and back to Demo Mode

### Can't Generate Demo Personas

**Problem:** The "Generate Buyer Persona" button is disabled for demo customers.

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure value components are loaded (90% completion required)
2. Make sure you've selected a demo customer from the dropdown
3. Check that no background task is running
4. Try refreshing the page

### Demo Data Disappears After Refresh

**Problem:** Demo data is gone after refreshing the page.

**Solutions:**
1. This shouldn't happen - demo data is saved to the database
2. Make sure you're logged in with the same user account
3. Try enabling Demo Mode again and loading demo data
4. Check that the demo company selector shows your selected company

### Switching Back to Real Mode Shows Empty Data

**Problem:** After switching from Demo Mode, your real value components are empty.

**Solutions:**
1. This is normal if you haven't set up real value components yet
2. Your real data is separate from demo data
3. You need to configure your real company values separately
4. Demo data doesn't affect your real data

---

## Summary

**Demo Mode** is a powerful feature that lets you:
- ✅ Try the app immediately without setup
- ✅ Learn the workflow with realistic data
- ✅ Experiment safely without affecting real data
- ✅ Train new users effectively
- ✅ Generate personas instantly (no website scraping)

**Remember:**
- Demo data is isolated from your real data
- Value components are still required (pre-filled in demo)
- You can switch between modes anytime
- Demo personas use the same quality standards

**Have fun exploring Value Rollercoaster with Demo Mode! 🎭**
