## About the Technology

### Why Streamlit?

This app is built with **Streamlit**, a Python framework that makes it fast to build data applications. I chose it because:
- **Rapid Development**: Allows building functional apps quickly
- **Python-Based**: Easy to integrate with AI models and data processing
- **Good for Data Apps**: Perfect for displaying analysis results and interactive charts
- **Open Source**: Full control over the code and deployment

### Important Differences from Regular Web Apps

Streamlit works differently than traditional web applications. Here are some things to know:

#### Navigation

**Browser Back Button Doesn't Work**
- Unlike regular websites, the browser's back button won't navigate between pages
- **Use the sidebar buttons** instead to move between tabs
- The app uses internal navigation buttons, not browser URLs

**No Direct URL Access**
- You can't bookmark specific pages or share direct links to personas
- Everything is accessed through the app's navigation system
- Use the search function to find saved personas instead of URLs

#### User Management

**Custom User System**
- Streamlit doesn't have built-in user management
- I added a custom authentication system
- You need to log in to use the app
- Your data is tied to your user account

#### Session Management

**Custom Session Handling**
- Streamlit's default session management is basic
- I built custom session management to handle:
  - Progress tracking during persona generation
  - Saving your work across page refreshes
  - Managing multiple tasks

**Page Refreshes**
- If you refresh the page, you'll stay logged in
- Your current work is preserved in most cases
- However, if a persona generation is in progress, refreshing might reset the progress display (the task continues in the background)

#### Other Differences

**No Traditional Browser History**
- The browser history won't show individual pages you've visited
- Use the app's navigation buttons to move around
- The sidebar always shows your current location

**Interaction Model**
- Every button click or input change can trigger a page refresh
- This is normal Streamlit behavior—the app reruns to update
- Don't worry if you see brief loading states—this is expected

**Limited Browser Control**
- Some browser features (like right-click context menus) may work differently
- Copy/paste works normally
- Keyboard shortcuts may behave differently than on regular websites

### What This Means for You

**What to Do:**
- ✅ Use sidebar buttons for navigation
- ✅ Use the app's search function to find content
- ✅ Wait for operations to complete before navigating away
- ✅ Use the "Clear Tasks" button if you need to reset

**What Not to Do:**
- ❌ Don't use the browser back button (use sidebar instead)
- ❌ Don't try to bookmark specific pages
- ❌ Don't refresh during persona generation (task continues, but progress display may reset)
- ❌ Don't expect traditional browser history

These differences are by design—Streamlit prioritizes rapid development and Python integration over traditional web app features. The app works well for its purpose, just with a slightly different interaction model.
