## Step 2: Value Components (Critical)

**⏱️ Time: 15-30 minutes**  
**👤 Who: Everyone**  
**🎯 Goal: Define your organization's values (90% completion required)**

### Why This Matters

Value Components are the **foundation** of everything:
- **Required for Persona Generation**: You need 90%+ completion to generate personas
- **Value Alignment**: Used to match your values with prospect needs
- **AI Analysis**: AI uses your values to provide relevant insights
- **Living Values**: Makes abstract values into actionable tools

### What "90% Completion" Means

You need to fill out **at least 90% of all value component fields** across 4 categories:
- **Technical Value**: Quality, Performance, Innovation, Sustainability
- **Business Value**: Cost Savings, Revenue Growth, Efficiency Gains
- **Strategic Value**: Competitive Advantage, Risk Mitigation, Partnership Development
- **After Sales Value**: Customer Support, Maintenance, User Experience

**Each category has subcategories and components** - fill out most of them to reach 90%.

### What You'll Do

1. **Navigate to Value Components**
   - Click **💎 Value Components** in sidebar
   - You'll see a summary view with completion status

2. **Check Current Completion**
   - Look for completion percentage (should show in summary)
   - If below 90%, you need to add more values

3. **Choose Your Approach**

   **Option A: AI Generation (Faster)**
   - Click **⚡ Generate Missing** to fill empty fields
   - Or click **🔄 Regenerate All** to start fresh
   - AI uses your Company Profile to suggest values
   - **Time**: 5-10 minutes
   - **Best for**: Quick setup, getting started

   **Option B: Manual Entry (Recommended - goal of the app)**
   - Navigate through categories (Technical, Business, Strategic, After Sales)
   - Fill in each value component manually
   - Edit AI-generated benefits if needed
   - **Time**: 20-30 minutes
   - **Best for**: Precise control, specific values


4. **Fill Value Components**

   For each component:
   - **Enter Your Value**: Describe what you offer (be specific!)
   - **AI Generates Benefit**: Automatically creates customer-focused benefit
   - **Edit if Needed**: Modify the AI-generated benefit
   - **Save**: Changes save automatically

5. **Verify Completion**
   - Check completion percentage in summary
   - Should be **90% or higher**
   - If not, add more values or use AI generation

### Tips for Value Components

- **Be Specific**: "We deliver 99.9% uptime" not "We're reliable"
- **Focus on Customer**: Describe customer benefit, not just features
- **Use Real Examples**: Reference actual customer success stories
- **Review AI Output**: AI suggestions are starting points - customize them
- **Complete All Categories**: Don't skip categories - fill all 4

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Too Generic**: "We're great" doesn't help - be specific
- ❌ **Skipping Categories**: Fill all 4 categories, not just one
- ❌ **Not Reaching 90%**: You need 90%+ to generate personas
- ❌ **Ignoring AI Suggestions**: AI can help - use it!

### ✅ Checkpoint
